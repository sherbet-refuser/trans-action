# TransAction Redistribution Council Charter

## Preamble

The TransAction Redistribution Council is established to equitably manage and distribute funds for the benefit of trans individuals in need. The Council operates on principles of transparency, collective decision-making, and mutual aid. This Charter sets forth the bylaws governing the Councilâ€™s membership, voting procedures, and fund management.

## Article I: Membership

1. **Eligibility Requirements**: Council membership is limited to individuals who:

   - Identify as transgender
   - Reside within King County, Washington

2. **Required Information**: Each Council member must provide and maintain current records of:

3. **Addition of Members**: A new Council member may be added via supermajority consent.
4. **Removal of Members**: A Council member may be removed via majority consent.
5. **Member Replacement**: A Council member may be replaced with a specific proposed new member via a single vote requiring supermajority consent. The member being replaced retains their right to vote on their replacement. This provision enables graceful transitions when members need to step down but wish to ensure continued Council operations.
6. **Resignation**: A Council member may resign at any time by providing written notice to the Council. The resignation is effective immediately upon receipt by any other Council member.
7. **Non-Hierarchical Membership**: All members of the Council hold equal status, with no hierarchical authority structure, except where Operational Roles specified in Article II grant additional authorizations.
8. **Term Recommendations**:
   - Members are encouraged to serve terms of approximately 6 months
   - At term end, members should consider transitioning their role to new community members through the replacement process
