# TransAction Redistribution Council Charter

## Preamble
The TransAction Redistribution Council is established to equitably manage and distribute funds for the benefit of trans individuals in need. The Council operates on principles of transparency, collective decision-making, and mutual aid. This Charter sets forth the bylaws governing the Councilâ€™s membership, voting procedures, and fund management.

## Article I: Membership
1. **Addition of Members**: A new Council member may be added via supermajority consent (100% - 1) of the existing Council.
2. **Removal of Members**: A Council member may be removed via majority consent (50% + 1) of the existing Council.
3. **Non-Hierarchical Membership**: All members of the Council hold equal status, with no hierarchical authority structure, except where direct fund access requires limited trusted roles.
4. **Legally Binding Commitment**: All members must sign a legally binding agreement to adhere to these bylaws.

## Article II: Voting Procedures
1. **Transaction Approval**: A transaction may be approved via majority consent of Council members.
2. **Conflict of Interest**: If a transaction would directly benefit a member of the Council, that member shall recuse themselves from voting on that transaction.
3. **Quorum Requirements**: No quorum is directly required to initiate a vote, so long as majority consent is met.
4. **Bylaw Amendments**: The Council may amend these bylaws via supermajority consent (100% - 1).
5. **Transparency of Votes**: All votes must be transparently logged and publicly available to maintain accountability.

## Article III: Fund Management
1. **Transaction Proposals**: Until a formal aid request system is implemented, transactions must be proposed by a Council member.
2. **Fund Access Control**: Until a trust-free system for authorizing transactions is available, access to direct management of the funds must be limited to as few Council members as possible, with no fewer than two members having access.
3. **Financial Transparency**: All fund balances and transactions shall be recorded and made publicly accessible, with donor and recipient identities anonymized as necessary.

## Ratification & Amendments
