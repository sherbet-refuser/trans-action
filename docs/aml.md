# Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Policy

## 1. Introduction

Our Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Policy ensures compliance with relevant regulations and safeguards against illicit financial activities. This policy outlines the procedures for identifying suspicious transactions, vetting aid recipients, and documenting all financial operations.

## 2. Policy Statement

All members and staff must adhere to AML best practices, including background checks on large or unusual transactions. Any attempt to misuse our aid distribution process for illegal activities will result in immediate action, including reporting to relevant authorities.

## 3. Recipient Due Diligence

- Aid recipients are required to submit basic identifying information and supporting documentation.
- Vetting procedures verify identity, financial need, and legitimacy of requests.
- Abnormally large or suspicious requests are investigated further, and relevant stakeholders are notified.

## 4. Board Member Oversight

- Council members recuse themselves from voting if potential conflicts of interest arise.
- Voting powers are limited if a member could financially benefit from a transaction.

## 5. Monitoring & Reporting

- All transactions are reviewed for patterns indicating money laundering.
- Suspected fraudulent or criminal activity is escalated to designated compliance personnel.
- Where required, an official Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) is prepared and filed.

## 6. Recordkeeping & Transparency

- Records of transactions and recipient information are maintained with strict confidentiality, in compliance with privacy laws.
- Public reporting on overall fund usage is provided without disclosing personal details.

## 7. Legal & Regulatory Compliance

- This organization will register as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit if annual gross receipts approach regulatory thresholds.
- Ongoing communication with legal and financial advisors ensures alignment with evolving regulations.
